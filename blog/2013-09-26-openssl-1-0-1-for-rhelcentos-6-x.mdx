<a href="https://www.ptudor.net/linux/openssl/">https://www.ptudor.net/linux/openssl/</a>  

This has been ported from the work done on Fedora OpenSSL (<a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/openssl ">https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/openssl</a> and <a href="http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/">http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/</a>). FIPS has been removed for ease of compiling.  

Have been running this on our dev environment for a few days and seems to be secure. OpenSSL 1.0.1 adds TLS 1.1/1.2 (changelog here: <a href="http://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html">http://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html</a>)
