title: OpenSSL 1.0.1 for RHEL/CentOS 6.x
---
This is a great page on how to build OpenSSL 1.0.1 for RHEL/CentOS 6.x:  

[https://www.ptudor.net/linux/openssl/](https://www.ptudor.net/linux/openssl/)  

This has been ported from the work done on Fedora OpenSSL ([https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/openssl](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/openssl) and [http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/)). FIPS has been removed for ease of compiling.  

Have been running this on our dev environment for a few days and seems to be secure. OpenSSL 1.0.1 adds TLS 1.1/1.2 (changelog here: [http://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html](http://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html))
