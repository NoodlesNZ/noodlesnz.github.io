title: Overheating Macbook Pro
---
I've been having problems recently with it overheating. It's not much fun when trying to code on the couch with a boiling hot mac on your lap.  

I found a program called [smcfancontrol](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23049/smcfancontrol) which seems to take care of that. It's now under 50oC and coding it now more fun!
