We found that Google had indexed a site that shouldn't be indexed so I setup a robots.txt file to deny all crawlers and locked down the site with http auth. I also put in a request to have the urls removed from the index and cache.  

When I did this Google returned ~2,400 results when doing a "site:www.site.com". A few days later it was returning ~54,000. Today it is returning ~133,000.  

I'm not sure how Google managed to mix up "remove my site" with "index it more". Maybe this is just part of the removal process?  

<strong>Update:</strong> Google is now up to 217,000 results for this site. Maybe removing your site from the index is good for SEO?
