title: DNS Stuff/DNS Report Alternative
---
Recently dnsstuff.com started charging for all their services and have doubled their prices. I know they're a business, but this move will force people away from their site onto other services.  

So I've been looking for an alternative to dnsstuff.com for a while and came across this: [https://dnssy.com](https://dnssy.com)  
It seems to have similar reports and is good for debugging your DNS setup.
