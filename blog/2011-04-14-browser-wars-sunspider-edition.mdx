title: Browser Wars (sunspider edition)
---
It seems that most browsers are focused on speeding up javascript execution now as most websites are heavy with ajax and complex js.  

With Firefox releasing their pre-beta "dev" version Aurora this morning I decided to run all the current browsers through sunspider to see if any progress has been made.  

Chrome-dev: 294ms  
Aurora (FF dev): 324ms  
Firefox 4: 348ms  
IE9: 251ms  
IE10 preview 1: 254ms  

So it would seem that Firefox has sped up their js engine, but has a little way to go to catch up to the other browsers.
