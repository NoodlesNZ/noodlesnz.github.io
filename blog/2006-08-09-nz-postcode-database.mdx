title: New Zealand Postcode Database
---
Due to the lack of data from NZ Post, I've created this mysql database from the PDF on the NZ Post website.   

{/* truncate */} 

All efforts have been made to ensure that there are no errors, but there are no guarantees, if you need 100% accurate data please buy NZ Post's PAF data.

Update: [New Zealand Postcode Database version 2](2007-09-14-new-zealand-postcode-database-v2.mdx)

Version 1:  

[nzpostcodes.sql.gz](pathname:///downloads/nzpostcodes.sql.gz) (467KB)  
[nzpostcodes.sql.bz2](pathname:///downloads/nzpostcodes.sql.bz2) (313KB)
