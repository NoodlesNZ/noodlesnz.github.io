title: Yarn audit fix
---
Yarn doesn't have the ability to fix the problems it finds in a security audit (like npm does). There is a workaround that I found on a github thread though:  

```
npm install
npm audit fix --force # breaking changes
rm yarn.lock
yarn import
yarn audit
rm package-lock.json
```

It's not pretty but it does the job.
