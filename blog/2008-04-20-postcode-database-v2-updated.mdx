title: Postcode Database V2 updated
---
As a few people have pointed out in the comments there was an error in the initial release of the V2 postcode database, the suburb data had been lost along the way.  

I've fixed the problem and updated the bzip2 and gzip files. I've also removed the mssql version as it never worked anyway. I'm not sure if the problem affects the csv version and I don't have time to look at it now.  

Enjoy.
