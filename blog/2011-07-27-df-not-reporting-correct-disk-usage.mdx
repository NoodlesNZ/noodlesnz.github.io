title: df not reporting correct disk usage
---
I had a problem where df and du disagreed with the amount of disk usage. The cause was processes holding on to unlinked files. Running the following identified the processes:  

```
ls -ld /proc/*/fd/* 2>&1 | fgrep '(deleted)'
```

I killed the processes and df is now showing the correct information.
