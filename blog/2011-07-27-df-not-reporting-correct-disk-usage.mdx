title: df not reporting correct disk usage

<p>I had a problem where df and du disagreed with the amount of disk usage. The cause was processes holding on to unlinked files. Running the following identified the processes: ls -ld /proc/*/fd/* 2&gt;&amp;1 | fgrep &#8216;(deleted)' I killed the processes and df is now showing the correct information.</p>
