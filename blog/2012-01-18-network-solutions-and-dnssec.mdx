title: Network Solutions and DNSSEC
---
It's interesting that not only does netsol not list any information what-so-ever on their knowledge base about DNSSEC, their support staff have no idea what it is either.  

Come on network solutions, sort it out otherwise I may have to move my domains to a registrar that does support DNSSEC.
