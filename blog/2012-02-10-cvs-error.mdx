I recently changed to using the unix command line for cvs and changed all my cvs roots to `:ext:` instead of `:ssh:` (tortoise prefers ssh).  

When I made the change, anytime I updated cvs I got this error:  

```
/CVSROOTccess /cvsroot
No such file or directory
```

This makes no sense. Luckily, after searching around I found this is a problem with DOS line breaks screwing with unix cvs. Running the following fixes the problem:  

```
dos2unix `find . -name Root`
dos2unix `find . -name Entries`
dos2unix `find . -name Repository`  
```
