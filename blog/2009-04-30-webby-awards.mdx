title: Webby Awards

The Webby Awards are upon us again for the 13th year. It's ironic though that awards that celebrate the best on the internet have one of the worst designed sites. The Webby People's Voice site is hard to register on and vote. This has discouraged a lot of people from voting for their favourite websites.
