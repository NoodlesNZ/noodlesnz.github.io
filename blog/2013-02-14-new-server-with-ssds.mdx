We just provisioned a new server with Sandy Bridge and 4 SSDs in RAID 5 configuration. The server it was replacing was seriously under powered so this is a timely replacement. I ran hdparm on both servers to compare:  

Old Server:
```
dag:/home# hdparm -Tt /dev/sda6

/dev/sda6:
 Timing cached reads:   6678 MB in  2.00 seconds = 3341.64 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 186 MB in  3.03 seconds =  61.38 MB/sec
```

New Server:
```
root@dagnew:/home# hdparm -Tt /dev/sda6  

/dev/sda6:
 Timing cached reads:   25048 MB in  2.00 seconds = 12539.88 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads: 1956 MB in  3.00 seconds = 651.75 MB/sec
```

I'll be rolling out more of these when other servers are up for replacement.
