title: unzip 6 for RHEL 5.6
---
Redhat likes to run old packages with backported patches, but sometimes it's nice to have the latest version that includes new features. Unfortunately the unzip from RHEL yum can't unzip files > 4GB. I found the src rpm and compiled binaries that work with RHEL 5.6 (may work with older).  

[unzip-6.0-1.i386.rpm](pathname:///downloads/unzip-6.0-1.i386.rpm)  
[unzip-6.0-1.x86_64.rpm](pathname:///downloads/unzip-6.0-1.x86_64.rpm)
