Microsoft have finally released IE10 for Windows 7. It seems their download page (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/downloads/ie-10/worldwide-languages" target="_blank">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/downloads/ie-10/worldwide-languages</a>) is getting pretty hammered. Looking at the requests on the page it seems that everything is held up with a request to ajax.microsoft.com. The page loads the template header, but no more. Surely in the day and age a company like Microsoft would load their ajax async and prevent a single script from taking down the page.  

Update: it seems this is a problem with the latest build of Firefox's Aurora. Twitter is experiencing a similar problem with one of their scripts, so there may be a problem with Firefox's script engine.
