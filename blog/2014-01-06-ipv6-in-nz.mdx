I just a quick survey of the top 500 sites in NZ (based on Alexa data) and I was disappointed to see that only two NZ based sites (excluding Google, Microsoft, Facebook etc) supported IPv6, <a href="http://www.geekzone.co.nz" target="_blank">geekzone.co.nz</a> and <a href="http://www.nzsale.co.nz" target="_blank">nzsale.co.nz (</a>Geekzone implemented its IPv6 via Cloudflare and NZ Sale through Akamai).  

Come on people, it's 2014. There's no excuse not to support IPv6, especially with two RIRs on their last /8 and APNIC with ~13.5 million addresses remaining. What's really worrying is that some of the major ISPS (Telecom, Vodafone, Orcon) don't even have IPv6 on their public facing websites. I'd guess that their residential customers won't be seeing IPv6 on their connections anytime soon and that CGN is a real possibility.
