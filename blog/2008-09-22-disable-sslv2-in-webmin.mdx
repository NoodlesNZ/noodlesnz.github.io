title: Disable SSLv2 in Webmin
---
I've been battling with Webmin trying to get SSLv2 turned off so I can comply with Hackersafe/McAfee Secure. 

{/* truncate */}

I managed to do it this morning, this is how I did it:  

- Upgrade to version 1.430
- Webmin -> Webmin Configuration -> SSL Encryption
- Enter HIGH:-SSLv2:-aNULL into the Allowed SSL Ciphers field (new as of 1.430)
- Restart Webmin  

You can check that SSLv2 is disabled by running this from the shell/command line:<br />
openssl s_client -connect localhost:10000 -ssl2  

If you get lines like these, SSLv2 is disabled:
```
419:error:1407F0E5:SSL routines:SSL2_WRITE:ssl handshake failure:s2_pkt.c:428:
420:error:1406D0B8:SSL routines:GET_SERVER_HELLO:no cipher list:s2_clnt.c:450:  
```
