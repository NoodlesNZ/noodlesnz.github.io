I've been battling with Webmin trying to get SSLv2 turned off so I can comply with Hackersafe/McAfee Secure.  

I managed to do it this morning, this is how I did it:  

&#8211; Upgrade to version 1.430<br />
&#8211; Webmin -&gt; Webmin Configuration -&gt; SSL Encryption<br />
&#8211; Enter HIGH:-SSLv2:-aNULL into the Allowed SSL Ciphers field (new as of 1.430)<br />
&#8211; Restart Webmin  

You can check that SSLv2 is disabled by running this from the shell/command line:<br />
openssl s_client -connect localhost:10000 -ssl2  

If you get lines like these, SSLv2 is disabled:<br />
419:error:1407F0E5:SSL routines:SSL2_WRITE:ssl handshake failure:s2_pkt.c:428:<br />
420:error:1406D0B8:SSL routines:GET_SERVER_HELLO:no cipher list:s2_clnt.c:450:
