title: Auckland Frost Dates
---
I had been searching for approximate frost dates for Auckland to help schedule veggie plantings. Luckily the people at [NIWA](https://niwa.co.nz/) are nice and respond very quickly to emails. I was told that ground frosts are days where grass minimum temperature are less than -1.0 degree C. Screen frosts are when the air temperature dips below 0.0 degrees C. [&hellip;]

Using NIWA's free data explorer tool "Cliflo" and the closest weather station to me I came up with the following data:  

2009  
First Frost: 2009-04-10  
Last Frost: 2009-09-09

First Frost: 2008-04-21  
Last Frost: 2008-09-07

First Frost: 2007-05-29  
Last Frost: 2007-10-04  

2006

Hopefully this helps the local gardeners.
