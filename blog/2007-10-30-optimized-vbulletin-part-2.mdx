title: Optimized vBulletin (Part 2)
---
I'm just trying out a new method to optimize vBulletin's front end scripts and CSS. It's still a work in progress but these are the results I have seen on my test site (www.wirelessforums.org)  

{/* truncate */}

*Without GZIP*  

Base VB (v3.6.8)  

vbulletin_global.js - 43.8KB  
vbulletin_menu.js - 17.8KB  
vbulletin_read_marker.js - 6.7KB  
vbulletin_md5.js - 9.6KB  

JS total - 77.9KB  

css - 5.7KB  

Using minify  

vbulletin_global.js - 23KB  
vbulletin_menu.js - 10.4KB  
vbulletin_read_marker.js - 3.3KB  
vbulletin_md5.js - 6KB  

JS total - 42.7 (45.1% savings)  

css - 4.1K (28% savings)  

*With GZIP*  

Base VB (v3.6.8)  

vbulletin_global.js - 12.5KB  
vbulletin_menu.js - 4.7KB  
vbulletin_read_marker.js - 2KB  
vbulletin_md5.js - 3.3KB  

JS total - 22.5KB  

css - 1.3KB  

Using minify and GZIP  

vbulletin_global.js - 6.9KB  
vbulletin_menu.js - 2.7KB  
vbulletin_read_marker.js - 1KB  
vbulletin_md5.js - 2.1KB  

JS total - 12.7KB  

This is an extra 43.5% savings on top of GZIP. A total of *65.2KB (83.7%)* savings from the original.  

css - 1.1KB  

An extra 15.3% savings on top of GZIP. A total of *4.6KB (80.7%)* savings from the original.  

This is a huge improvement over the original file sizes and speeds up rendering of the page quite a bit. The new method doesn't require you to download JS replacements for each version of vB, instead it works off the existing files. Hopefully this will silence the people who complained about copyright/piracy issues with me distributing the JS files (even though they're distributed to every browser that downloads the page).  

I'm also looking at some other ways to speed up rendering as much as possible. Stay tuned for downloads and a full write up.
