I've done a bit of work on the database, added a bit of information and corrected mistakes.  

Thanks to Owen and others for help with the data.  

*What's new in V2*

- More accurate
- Added GPS co-ordinates
- Added PO Boxes and Private Bags
- Added Rural postcodes
- Removed regions (as some datasources labeled a city/town as one region and others differed.)

I've also taken the opportunity to include CSV and MSSQL formats, as well as MySQL.  

*History* 

I originally created the database as I needed street and suburb data for a project I was doing. No one else was stupid enough to spend that much time on it, so I took it on. NZ Post still has their PAF data, but are unlikely to release a free database of the postcodes.

All efforts have been made to ensure that there are no errors, but there are no guarantees, if you need 100% accurate data please buy NZ Postâ€™s PAF data.  

[UPDATE 20/04/08]
As a few people have pointed out, there was no suburb data in the MySQL database version of the postcode database. This has now been fixed. Sorry about the problems and how long it's taken me to get around to fixing it.
