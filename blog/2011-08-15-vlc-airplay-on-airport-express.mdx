title: VLC Airplay on Airport Express
---
There is a way to stream music to your airport express from VLC (means you don't have to install iTunes).  

Under preferences > all > stream output enter this in the "Default stream output chain":  

```
#transcode{acodec=alac,channels=2,samplerate=44100}:raop{host=<ip address of aiport express>,volume=175}
```
