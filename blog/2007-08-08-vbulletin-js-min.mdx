I realized today that vBulletin's Javascript was just too bulky and didn't really need to be, especially when you have no plans to customize it yourself. So I grabbed all the packages of 3.6.x and minimized all the Javascript. In most cases the Javascript files are 50% of the original, which saves bandwidth and speeds up the loading of your forum.  

Install:  

- Backup all the .js files from the clientscript directory under your forum root.
- Copy the files from zip file that matches your version of vBulletin into the clientscript directory.
- Done!
