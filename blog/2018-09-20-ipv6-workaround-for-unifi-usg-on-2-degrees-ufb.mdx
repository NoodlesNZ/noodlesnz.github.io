title: ipv6 workaround for Unifi USG on 2 Degrees UFB
---
I had an issue where our USG Pro was not getting ipv6 from 2 Degrees UFB after upgrading our Controller to 5.8. After a lot of messing around with this, I found a workaround originally posted here: [https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Routing-Switching/USG-DHCPv6-PD-bug-when-using-PPPoE/td-p/2487710](https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Routing-Switching/USG-DHCPv6-PD-bug-when-using-PPPoE/td-p/2487710).

Digging into the dhcpv6-pd logs shows this:  

```
admin@SecurityGateway:~$ show dhcpv6-pd log
Sep/12/2018 08:14:08: dhcp6_ctl_init: bind(control sock): Address already in use
Sep/12/2018 08:14:08: client6_init: failed to initialize control channel
```

Dumping out the config I saw that I had two dhcpv6-pd blocks, one under interface eth2 vif 10 and the other under interface eth2 vif 10 pppoe 2 (where it should be):  

```
mca-ctrl -t dump-cfg

                                            "local": {
                                                    "ipv6-name": "WANv6_LOCAL",
                                                    "name": "WAN_LOCAL"
                                            },
                                            "out": {
                                                    "ipv6-name": "WANv6_OUT",
                                                    "name": "WAN_OUT"
                                            }
                                    },
                                    "ipv6": {
                                            "address": "autoconf",
                                            "enable": "''"
                                    },
                                    "name-server": "none",
                                    "password": "<password>",
                                    "user-id": "<username>"
                            }
                    }
            }
    }
}
```

It was possible to temporarily fix this issue by removing the first block:  

```
configure
delete interfaces ethernet eth2 vif 10 dhcpv6-pd
commit
exit

release dhcpv6-pd interface pppoe2
delete dhcpv6-pd duid
renew dhcpv6-pd interface pppoe2
```

This allowed our USG to get ipv6 from our ISP and now all the clients on the network also got ipv6.  

To make this more permanent I had to add this file on the USG under `/config/scripts/post-config.d/dhcp.sh`  

```
#!/bin/vbash

readonly logFile="/var/log/postprovision.log"

source /opt/vyatta/etc/functions/script-template

configure > ${logFile}

delete system task-scheduler task postprovision >> ${logFile}

delete interfaces ethernet eth2 vif 10 dhcpv6-pd >> ${logFile}
commit
exit

release dhcpv6-pd interface pppoe2 >> ${logFile}
delete dhcpv6-pd duid  >> ${logFile}
renew dhcpv6-pd interface pppoe2 >> ${logFile}
```


To run this script, I added the following on the Controller in `/usr/lib/unifi/data/sites/default/config.gateway.json`:  

```
{
    "system":{
        "task-scheduler":{
            "task":{
                "postprovision":{
                    "executable":{
                        "path":"/config/scripts/post-config.d/dhcp.sh"
                    },
                    "interval":"2m"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This runs the dhcp.sh script 2 minutes after provisioning and then the script removes the scheduled task (as it only needs to run once).
