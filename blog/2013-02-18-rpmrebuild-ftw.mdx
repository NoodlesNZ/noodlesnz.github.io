title: rpmrebuild ftw!

There's always been a problem with Oracle provided MySQL rpms and older Centos/RHEL MySQL rpms. The former provides "MySQL" and the latter provides "mysql", so a lot of the packages in Centos/RHEL require "mysql" which creates some conflicts.  

A quick way to fix this is to use `rpmrebuild -e -p <rpmfile>` and change the "requires" from "mysql" to "MySQL". Hopefully in the future Centos/RHEL will be standardized with the Oracle naming convention or Oracle packages be "backwardly" compatible.
