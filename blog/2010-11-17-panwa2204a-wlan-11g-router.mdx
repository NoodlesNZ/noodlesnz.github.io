title: PANWA2204A WLAN 11g Router
---
I came a cross an unbranded router with the FCC ID PANWA2204A stamped on the bottom (with MAC addresses and serial number). If anyone else is trying to identify one of these it's a "[RadioLabs High Power O2Link Broadband Turbo G Router](http://www.radiolabs.com/products/wireless/networking/radiolabs-wireless-router.php)".
