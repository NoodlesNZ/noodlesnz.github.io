This Java app can be containerised for portability/ease of setup and use.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI created a simple docker compose setup ([https://github.com/NoodlesNZ/devpops-test](https://github.com/NoodlesNZ/devpops-test)).  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis can be used with a real certificate (which is signed by a CA), but works as well with a self signed certificate using (on a Mac):  \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nopenssl req \\\\\\r\\n    -newkey rsa:2048 \\\\\\r\\n    -x509 \\\\\\r\\n    -nodes \\\\\\r\\n    -keyout server.key \\\\\\r\\n    -new \\\\\\r\\n    -out server.crt \\\\\\r\\n    -subj /CN=www.example.com \\\\\\r\\n    -reqexts SAN \\\\\\r\\n    -extensions SAN \\\\\\r\\n    -config <(cat /System/Library/OpenSSL/openssl.cnf \\\\\\r\\n        <(printf \'[SAN]\\\\nsubjectAltName=DNS:www.example.com\')) \\\\\\r\\n    -sha256 \\\\\\r\\n    -days 3650\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis is included in the conf/config.json file:  \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n{\\r\\n  \\"connectorServerInfo\\": {\\r\\n    \\"secure\\": true,\\r\\n    \\"port\\": 443,\\r\\n    \\"host\\": \\"0.0.0.0\\",\\r\\n    \\"cert\\": {\\r\\n      \\"certChainPath\\": \\"./conf/server.crt\\",\\r\\n      \\"keyPath\\": \\"./conf/server.key\\"\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  \\"originMappings\\": [\\r\\n    {\\r\\n      \\"from\\": \\"<ORIGIN HOST>\\",\\r\\n      \\"to\\": {\\r\\n        \\"secure\\": true,\\r\\n        \\"port\\": 8443,\\r\\n        \\"host\\": \\"host.docker.internal\\"\\r\\n      }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n  \\"jwt\\": \\"<ENTER JWT HERE>\\"\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nExplaining a few options in the config.json file.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the connectorServerInfo section:\\r\\n- secure: true - enables https\\r\\n- port: 443 - listens on port 443\\r\\n- host: 0.0.0.0 - bind to all ip addresses (needed for docker as binding to 127.0.0.1 doesn\'t work)\\r\\n- cert - public/private key as generated with openssl  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the originMappings section:\\r\\n- from: `<ORIGIN HOST>` - the origin hostname in your Akamai property, e.g. origin.example.com\\r\\n- to - the local/development origin\\r\\n- secure: true - enabled https on the new origin\\r\\n- port: 8443 - As the Sandbox is now listening on port 443, the origin needs to be on a different port\\r\\n- host: host.docker.internal - special docker hostname on mac, which resolves to the host\'s ip address. This assumes that your dev server is also hosted on your mac.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis setup can also be incorporated into an existing docker compose setup, e.g.  \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nversion: \'2\'\\r\\nservices:\\r\\n  web:\\r\\n    image: example/web:latest\\r\\n    networks:\\r\\n      - appnet\\r\\n  devpops:\\r\\n    image: noodlesnz/devpops:latest\\r\\n    volumes:\\r\\n      - ./conf:/opt/devpops/conf\\r\\n    ports:\\r\\n      - 443:443\\r\\n    networks:\\r\\n      - appnet\\r\\nnetworks:\\r\\n  appnet:\\r\\n    driver: \\"bridge\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\nWith web and devpops sharing the same docker network, you can use the host \\"web\\" with your config.json, e.g.  \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n{\\r\\n  \\"connectorServerInfo\\": {\\r\\n    \\"secure\\": true,\\r\\n    \\"port\\": 443,\\r\\n    \\"host\\": \\"0.0.0.0\\",\\r\\n    \\"cert\\": {\\r\\n      \\"certChainPath\\": \\"./conf/server.crt\\",\\r\\n      \\"keyPath\\": \\"./conf/server.key\\"\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  \\"originMappings\\": [\\r\\n    {\\r\\n      \\"from\\": \\"<ORIGIN HOST>\\",\\r\\n      \\"to\\": {\\r\\n        \\"secure\\": true,\\r\\n        \\"port\\": 443,\\r\\n        \\"host\\": \\"web\\"\\r\\n      }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n  \\"jwt\\": \\"<ENTER JWT HERE>\\"\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis also means that the development origin can only be accessed through the Akamai Sandbox, as web doesn\'t have any ports exposed."},{"id":"/2018/09/20/ipv6-workaround-for-unifi-usg-on-2-degrees-ufb","metadata":{"permalink":"/2018/09/20/ipv6-workaround-for-unifi-usg-on-2-degrees-ufb","source":"@site/blog/2018-09-20-ipv6-workaround-for-unifi-usg-on-2-degrees-ufb.mdx","title":"ipv6 workaround for Unifi USG on 2 Degrees UFB","description":"I had an issue where our USG Pro was not getting ipv6 from 2 Degrees UFB after upgrading our Controller to 5.8.

vif 10 dhcpv6-pd\\ncommit\\nexit\\n\\nrelease dhcpv6-pd interface pppoe2\\ndelete dhcpv6-pd duid\\nrenew dhcpv6-pd interface pppoe2\\n```\\n\\nThis allowed our USG to get ipv6 from our ISP and now all the clients on the network also got ipv6.  \\n\\nTo make this more permanent I had to add this file on the USG under `/config/scripts/post-config.d/dhcp.sh`  \\n\\n```\\n#!/bin/vbash\\n\\nreadonly logFile=\\"/var/log/postprovision.log\\"\\n\\nsource /opt/vyatta/etc/functions/script-template\\n\\nconfigure > ${logFile}\\n\\ndelete system task-scheduler task postprovision >> ${logFile}\\n\\ndelete interfaces ethernet eth2 vif 10 dhcpv6-pd >> ${logFile}\\ncommit\\nexit\\n\\nrelease dhcpv6-pd interface pppoe2 >> ${logFile}\\ndelete dhcpv6-pd duid  >> ${logFile}\\nrenew dhcpv6-pd interface pppoe2 >> ${logFile}\\n```\\n\\n\\nTo run this script, I added the following on the Controller in `/usr/lib/unifi/data/sites/default/config.gateway.json`:  \\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\"system\\":{\\n        \\"task-scheduler\\":{\\n            \\"task\\":{\\n                \\"postprovision\\":{\\n                    \\"executable\\":{\\n                        \\"path\\":\\"/config/scripts/post-config.d/dhcp.sh\\"\\n                    },\\n                    \\"interval\\":\\"2m\\"\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis runs the dhcp.sh script 2 minutes after provisioning and then the script removes the scheduled task (as it only needs to run once)."},{"id":"/2015/07/08/speed-up-jenkins-phpcs-php-codesniffer","metadata":{"permalink":"/2015/07/08/speed-up-jenkins-phpcs-php-codesniffer","source":"@site/blog/2015-07-08-speed-up-jenkins-phpcs-php-codesniffer.mdx","title":"Speed

Also, from what I\'m reading this tool is still very much a \\"beta\\" and is quite buggy.  \\n\\nThe tool itself is not revolutionary, there are many other systems out there that do a similar thing. What is interesting though is that Amazon is offering this, once again improving the tools available without the need to use a 3rd party. Will this kill off competition or prompt the current providers to lift their game?  \\n\\nOpsWorks has brought up an interesting question. Now that AWS is using Chef and they have thousands of developers/sites using them, will Chef become the defacto standard and will other configuration management systems die out? There is a rumour that Amazon might offer Puppet support along side Chef, but that\'s just a rumour for now.  \\n\\nPersonally I think Chef will increase in popularity due to OpsWorks, but I don\'t think Puppet et al will die away.

For example Facebook\'s CDN solution (using Akamai) resolves static.ak.fbcdn.net to 210.55.501.200, a 5ms response time. Using Google\'s public DNS server (8.8.8.8) the same domain resolves to 72.246.43.42, 72.246.43.32, a 200ms response time.  \\n\\nSo while using Google\'s DNS/OpenDNS may save a few ms while resolving a domain, it may slow down a site by putting the CDN pops further away from end users.

As it\'s not very well documented I thought I\'d share it with everyone.\\n\\nFirst set your apache server to display status in the apache httpd.conf:  \\n\\n```\\n<Location /server-status>\\nSetHandler server-status\\nOrder deny,allow\\nDeny from all\\nAllow from 127.0.0.1\\n</Location>  \\n\\nExtendedStatus On\\n```\\n\\nSetting extended status to On does slow down the server a little bit, but it\'s usually not noticeable. Remember to limit access to the status page to just the IP where your Big Brother server is monitoring from.  \\n\\nAdd apache to @DATALIST in larrd-config.pl  \\n\\nThen in your apache-larrd.pl (under the larrd directory) you\'ll need to hardcode the servers you want to monitor.  \\n\\n```\\n%host_h = (\\n    \u2018server01\u2019 => {\\n        port => \u201c80\u201d,\\n        url => \u201chttp://www.yoursite.com/server-status?auto\u201d,\\n    }\\n);\\n``` \\n\\nThe first part of the host_h array is to identify which server to attach the RRD file with. In this instance I\'m monitoring a server called server01 and the website I have setup with the server-status page is http://www.youresite.com/server-status?auto. If your host is a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) then you can omit the full url and just have /server-status?auto and Big Brother will work out the URL.  \\n\\nWith any luck you\'ll have 4 new graphs on your trends/LARRD page."},{"id":"/2007/01/31/google-sitemap-generator","metadata":{"permalink":"/2007/01/31/google-sitemap-generator","source":"@site/blog/2007-01-31-google-sitemap-generator.mdx","title":"Google Sitemap Generator","description":"I was dissapointed when I saw the current Google sitemap generators available, so I wrote one.","date":"2007-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Google Sitemap Generator"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Monitoring Apache with LARRD and Big Brother","permalink":"/2007/05/25/monitoring-apache-with-larrd-and-big-brother"},"nextItem":{"title":"MySQL and Redhat Enterprise Linux 4","permalink":"/2006/12/01/mysql-and-redhat-enterprise-linux-4"}},"content":"I was dissapointed when I saw the current Google sitemap generators available, so I wrote one. \\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Generates Google sitemaps\\n- Generates Yahoo!  sitemaps\\n- Generates plain text sitemap\\n- Splits sitemaps up into smaller files (as per Google\'s instructions)\\n- Creates sitemap index file\\n- Pings Google/Yahoo!  \\n\\nThis is the first release, so there\'s probably some bugs in there somewhere.
